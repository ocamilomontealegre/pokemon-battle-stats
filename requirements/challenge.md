# Pok√©mon Battle Stats Challenge

## Context

Imagine you are building an application to track Pok√©mon battles. Each trainer has several Pok√©mon, and battles take place between them. The goal of this challenge is to practice using **Mongoose aggregation** to process and analyze data.

## Objectives of the Challenge

### 1. Models to Create

- **Trainer:** Includes attributes like name, age, and region.
- **Pokemon:** Includes name, type, level, health points, attack, and defense.
- **Battle:** Tracks battles between two trainers, the Pok√©mon involved, the result, and the winning trainer.

### 2. Populate the Models with Sample Data

- Create at least **2 trainers**.
- Create at least **4 different Pok√©mon** (from different types, e.g., Electric, Fire, Water, etc.).
- Create at least **3 battles** between the trainers.

### 3. Aggregation Queries

#### a. **Strongest Pok√©mon:**

Create a query to determine which **Pok√©mon has the highest combined level** of attack, defense, and health points. You can use a formula like: level + attack + defense + healthPoints

The query should return the strongest Pok√©mon.

#### b. **Trainer with the Most Victories:**

Write a query to identify the **trainer with the most victories**. Use aggregation to count the victories of each trainer and return the trainer with the most wins.

#### c. **Battle Statistics:**

Write a query that returns the **result** of each battle, with the Pok√©mon involved and the **total damage dealt** in the battle. This should include the health point difference between the Pok√©mon to determine how much damage was done during the battle.

#### d. **Most Used Pok√©mon:**

Find which **Pok√©mon participated in the most battles**. You can use `$lookup` to join battles with the involved Pok√©mon.

### 4. Additional Challenges

#### a. **Battle Duration:**

Add a field to each battle that indicates the **turn** in which a Pok√©mon was defeated. Create a query that calculates how many turns each battle lasted.

#### b. **Trainer Ranking:**

Use aggregation to rank the trainers by **number of victories** and display the **top 3 trainers** with the most wins.

---

## How to Get Started?

1. Create an **Express server**.
2. Define your **Mongoose models** for **Pokemon**, **Trainer**, and **Battle**.
3. Use aggregation operations like **$group**, **$match**, **$sort**, **$project**, **$unwind**, and **$lookup** to solve the queries.
4. Insert sample data and test the aggregation queries.

Good luck and enjoy the challenge! üöÄ
